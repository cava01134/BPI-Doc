The Banana Pi Leaf series is a low-power microcontroller development board designed for IoT (Internet of Things) projects.

BPI-Leaf-S3 is equipped with the latest flagship - ESP32-S3 chip from Espressif, supports 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® LE dual-mode wireless communication, with its low-power hardware design, it consumes only 10uA in deep sleep mode.

The board supports two power supply modes: USB and external 3.7V lithium battery, which can automatically switch to USB power function when both are connected at the same time, and can support reverse charging the battery via USB. Its small size, convenient pins layout, ease of use, and plentiful features that can be directly applied to low-power IoT projects.

In terms of software, the BPI-Leaf-S3 supports various mainstream platforms including ESP-IDF, Arduino, MicroPython and other methods for programming and development.

All I/O pins corresponding to the chip are marked with numbers on the BPI-Leaf-S3, and the order of the I/O pins is consistent with the Espressif ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 development board. Developers can use peripherals that are compatable with DevKitC-1 according to actual needs, it can also be installed onto the breadboard for ease of use.

## Programming with MicroPython

Regardless of the programmer is a beginner or not, MicroPython is considered to be less difficult to develop than other MCU programming languages.

Its code is easy to understand compared to other programming languages, and it has various resources accumulated over the years by the open source community.

Just like Python, it has strong vitality and application value.

By uploading the MicroPython firmware, you can use the Python language to program in the development board.
