Regardless of the programmer is a beginner or not, MicroPython is considered to be less difficult to develop than other MCU programming languages.

Its code is easy to understand compared to other programming languages, and has large amounts of resources accumulated over the years by the open source community.

Just like Python, it has a strong vitality and application value.

By uploading the MicroPython firmware, you can use the Python language to program in the development board.

## Programming with CircuitPython

CircuitPython is a programming language designed to simplify programming experiments and learning on microcontroller development boards.

CircuitPython programming with the Mu editor is the least difficult way to get started. Install the software and connect the device to start using it.

## Programming with Arduino
