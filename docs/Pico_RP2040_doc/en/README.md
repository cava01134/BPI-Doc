The Banana Pi Pico series is a low-power microcontroller development board designed for IoT (Internet of Things) projects.

BPI-Pico-RP2040 is a development board launched by Banana Pi equipped with the RP2040 chip. Its most notable feature is retaining most the function of the Raspberry Pi Pico. With the same dimention and pin layout, it has an additional WS2812 LED, replaced the 3-Pin debug socket with a SH 1mm 4-pin socket, which can be paired with Qwiic & STEMMA QT or other compatible peripherals; also replacing the micro-USB socket with a USB Type-C socket, which may be inserted in either orientation.

Regardless of the programmer is a beginner or not, MicroPython is considered to be less difficult to develop than other MCU programming languages.

Its code is easy to understand compared to other programming languages, and it has various resources accumulated over the years by the open source community.

Just like Python, it has strong vitality and application value.

By uploading the MicroPython firmware, you can use the Python language to program in the development board.

## Programming with CircuitPython

CircuitPython is a programming language designed to simplify programming experiments and learning on microcontroller development boards.

CircuitPython programming with the Mu editor is the least difficult way to get started. Install the software and connect the device to start using it.

## Programming with Arduino
